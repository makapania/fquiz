# Handoff – 2025-10-27

## Overview
This handoff documents the fixes and improvements applied to ensure the Sets and Home pages show accurate counts and newly created sets appear without stale caching. It also captures current status, verification steps, and recommended next actions.

## Changes Implemented
- Home page (`app/page.tsx`)
  - Forced dynamic rendering: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to avoid serving cached content.
  - Switched to explicit server-side count queries for each set:
    - Fetches `cards` and `questions` counts using `count: 'exact'` + `head: true` to compute `card_count` and `question_count` per set.
    - Avoids nested aggregation quirks from `cards(count)` / `questions(count)`.
- Sets list page (`app/sets/page.tsx`)
  - Forced dynamic rendering: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to ensure fresh data when sets are published/unpublished or newly created.
- API – Cards insert (`app/api/sets/[id]/cards/route.ts`)
  - After inserting a card, updates the parent set’s `updated_at` timestamp to reflect recent activity.
  - Ensures the “Recent Sets” ordering remains correct and that revalidation signals have fresh timestamps.
- API – Questions insert (`app/api/sets/[id]/questions/route.ts`)
  - After inserting a question, updates the parent set’s `updated_at` timestamp.
- General checks and context
  - Confirmed RLS policies: public can read published sets/cards/questions only; service-role server can bypass RLS where needed.
  - Verified Admin publish actions call `router.refresh()` and API `PATCH` on `/api/sets/[id]`.
  - Confirmed new set creation endpoint exists at `POST /api/sets` and returns the new set ID.

## Current Status
- Recent set counts on the Home page now come from exact totals computed server-side and should match the editor/study/take views.
- Newly created sets appear on the Sets page and Home page without being blocked by static caching.
- “Recent Sets” ordering updates when cards/questions are added thanks to `updated_at` bumps.

## Verification Steps
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/` and check “Recent Sets” counts.
- Create a new set (`/sets/new`), then return to Home and Sets pages; the set should appear.
- Add cards/questions to an existing set and hard reload Home; counts should match the editor’s list and study/take pages.

## Notes & Constraints
- RLS: unauthenticated users see only published sets and their content. Server-side queries using the service role can read more broadly when necessary.
- Passcode and publish controls continue to operate via `/api/sets/[id]` and `/api/sets/[id]/passcode/manage`.

## Next Actions
- If any specific set still shows mismatched counts, collect the set ID and expected numbers and we’ll trace DB rows versus rendered output.
- Optionally add targeted revalidation on mutations if we want stricter cache control beyond dynamic rendering.

## Files Touched (Summary)
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/sets/page.tsx`
- `app/api/sets/[id]/cards/route.ts`
- `app/api/sets/[id]/questions/route.ts`

## How to Run
- `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Use Admin controls on a set to publish/unpublish and to add content; confirm count updates on Home and Sets pages.
