# Development Session Handoff - October 26, 2025 (Evening)

## Summary
This session attempted to fix passcode security and user ownership tracking. While we made progress on some areas, we encountered significant challenges with the user database architecture that require further investigation.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### 1. **User Ownership Tracking Not Working**
**Problem:** The `created_by` field in sets is not being populated correctly, even though user records are being created.

**Root Cause:**
- Users ARE being created in the `users` table during OAuth sign-in (confirmed by log: `[NextAuth] Creating new user in database: matt.sponheimer@gmail.com`)
- However, when we immediately try to look up the same user by email, the query returns no results
- This suggests either:
  - Database transaction timing issue (user not committed yet)
  - Users table structure is different than expected
  - Supabase client permissions issue
  - Race condition between insert and select

**Current State:**
- Set creation works ✅
- Editing works ✅
- But `created_by` is always NULL ❌

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
[NextAuth] Creating new user in database: matt.sponheimer@gmail.com
[CREATE SET] Session: matt.sponheimer@gmail.com
[CREATE SET] User lookup: { found: false, userId: undefined, error: undefined }
[CREATE SET] created_by: null
```

---

## ✅ WHAT WORKS NOW

### 1. **Basic Set Creation and Editing**
- Any signed-in user can create sets ✅
- Any signed-in user can edit sets ✅
- Sets are created successfully ✅

### 2. **Passcode Protection (Partial)**
- Passcode-protected quizzes require passcode for logged-out users ✅
- ALL signed-in users bypass passcode (not ideal, but functional) ⚠️
- Passcode cookies are cleared on sign-out ✅

### 3. **OAuth Authentication**
- Google OAuth working correctly ✅
- User creation in database triggered on sign-in ✅
- Local development using port 3000 correctly ✅

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical
1. **User Lookup Failure** - Users are created but cannot be queried immediately
   - Affects: created_by field, owner-only access
   - Workaround: Currently allowing all signed-in users to edit

2. **Passcode Bypass Too Broad** - ALL signed-in users bypass passcode
   - Expected: Only set owner should bypass
   - Current: Any logged-in user bypasses
   - Impact: Moderate security issue, but logged-out users still blocked

### Minor
1. **Debug Logging Still Active** - Console logs should be removed before production
2. **created_by NULL for All Existing Sets** - Need migration once user lookup works
3. **Multiple Dev Servers Running** - Background bash processes should be cleaned up

---

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION NEEDED

### User Database Structure
**Action Required:** Examine the `users` table schema in Supabase

Questions to answer:
1. What is the actual structure of the `users` table?
2. Are there any unique constraints or indexes on `email`?
3. Is there RLS (Row Level Security) blocking the query?
4. Is there a trigger or policy that might affect immediate reads?

**How to Check:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'matt.sponheimer@gmail.com';

-- Check table structure
\d users;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

### Supabase Client Permissions
**Action Required:** Verify the Supabase client has read access to users table

The server-side client (`supabaseServer()`) might not have permission to read the users table even though it can insert.

| Create set | ❌ Can't create | ✅ Can create | ✅ Can create |
| Edit set | ❌ Can't edit | ❌ Can't edit others' sets | ✅ Can edit own sets |

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (PRIORITY ORDER)

### Immediate (Before Any Other Work)

1. **Investigate User Lookup Failure**
   - Check Supabase users table structure
   - Verify RLS policies
   - Test direct SQL queries
   - Check if user email case-sensitivity matters
   - Consider adding delay or retry logic

2. **Fix or Remove Owner Tracking**
   - If fixable: Implement proper owner-only access
   - If not fixable quickly: Remove created_by logic entirely and document limitation

### Short-Term (After User Issue Resolved)

3. **Implement "My Sets" Page**
   - Page to view only your own sets
   - Delete functionality
   - Only implement if owner tracking works

4. **Integrate funkyhom.png Branding**
   - Add mascot to welcome page
   - Add to quiz results with conditional rendering
   - See FEATURES.md for details

5. **Add Search and Unique IDs**
   - Search bar for quiz/flashcard titles
   - Generate 4-digit IDs (Q#### for quizzes, F#### for flashcards)
   - See FEATURES.md for details

### Future

6. **Clean Up Debug Logging**
   - Remove console.log statements from production code
   - Keep only essential error logging

7. **Clean Up Background Processes**
   - Multiple `npm run dev` sessions running
   - Kill unused background bash shells

### Uncommitted Changes
All changes from this session are UNCOMMITTED. Review before committing:

- ✅ `FEATURES.md` - Safe to commit
- ⚠️ `src/lib/authOptions.ts` - User creation logic (may need revision)

## 🔑 KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

### User Lookup Pattern (NOT WORKING)
```typescript
const { data: user } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('id')
  .eq('email', session.user.email)
  .single();
// Returns null even immediately after user creation
```

### Passcode Logic (CURRENT)
```typescript
const needsPass = !!set.passcode_required && !hasValidPasscode && !isOwner && !isSignedIn;
// This allows ANY signed-in user to bypass - not ideal
```

### User Creation (WORKING)
```typescript
// In authOptions.ts signIn callback
if (!existingUser) {
  await supabase.from('users').insert({
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name || null,
  });
}
// Insert succeeds, but subsequent query fails
```

## 📞 QUESTIONS FOR USER/STAKEHOLDER

1. **Is it acceptable for ALL signed-in users to bypass passcodes temporarily?**
   - Or should we disable passcode feature until owner-only access works?

2. **What is the actual users table structure in Supabase?**
   - Need schema to debug the lookup issue

3. **Priority: Fix ownership OR implement new features?**
   - Should we focus on fixing the database issue or move forward with features?

---

## 🎯 SESSION GOALS VS OUTCOMES

### Goals
- ✅ Fix passcode bypass vulnerability
- ❌ Implement owner-only passcode bypass (partially - all users bypass)
- ✅ Clear passcode cookies on sign-out
- ❌ Fix editing permissions to owner-only (reverted to all signed-in)
- ✅ Create FEATURES.md document

### Outcomes
- Passcode protection works for logged-out users ✅
- Passcode cookies clear on sign-out ✅
- Set creation and editing works ✅
- Owner tracking doesn't work due to database query issue ❌
- All signed-in users can edit all sets (security concern) ⚠️

---

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Database Transactions Are Tricky** - Just because an insert succeeds doesn't mean the data is immediately queryable

2. **Supabase RLS Policies** - May need to check if Row Level Security is interfering with queries

3. **Simpler is Better** - The isSignedIn approach works; don't overcomplicate with ownership until necessary

4. **Test Incrementally** - Should have tested user lookup independently before integrating into multiple places

**End of Handoff Document**
*Session focused on passcode security and user ownership. Core functionality restored, but owner tracking remains unsolved.*
