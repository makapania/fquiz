# FQuiz Handoff – October 28, 2025 (Final)

## 🚀 Current Status
- Main branch updated with guest ownership fixes, security hardening, and merge conflict resolution.
- Local dev runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Supabase migrations include idempotent RLS updates and `users.password_hash` support.

## ✅ Changes Consolidated (Oct 27–28)
- Guest ownership and permissions
  - `app/api/sets/route.ts`: `POST /api/sets` now sets `created_by` using either NextAuth session email or `guest_email` cookie.
  - Align UI permissions: sets pages recognize guest cookies so guests can create, edit, and manage their own sets.
- Security & auth
  - Prevent password creation for existing OAuth users during guest check-in.
  - Migration added: `supabase/migrations/0005_users_password.sql` (adds `users.password_hash`).
- RLS & migrations
  - `supabase/migrations/0004_rls_insert_policies.sql`: ensure idempotent policy updates for `sets`, `cards`, `questions` (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
  - `VERIFY_RLS.md`: added steps to verify effective policies in Supabase.
- UI/UX tweaks
  - Study page completion keeps the image and fixes banner copy to “too school for cool”.
  - Sets and detail pages consistently show controls based on session OR guest cookie.
- Merge resolution
  - Resolved conflict in `app/sets/[id]/study/page.tsx` by keeping wrapper layout, image, and corrected completion text.

## 🔎 Key Files
- `app/api/sets/route.ts` – Guest-aware `POST` (created_by from session or `guest_email` cookie).
- `app/sets/[id]/page.tsx` – Permission checks recognize guest sessions.
- `app/sets/page.tsx` – “Create set” link and visibility match session or guest state.
- `app/components/WelcomeAuth.tsx` – Guest check-in/checkout flows and messages.
- `supabase/migrations/0004_rls_insert_policies.sql` – Idempotent RLS policies.
- `supabase/migrations/0005_users_password.sql` – Adds `users.password_hash` for non-OAuth guest cases.
- `app/sets/[id]/study/page.tsx` – UI conflict resolved and copy adjusted.

## 🧪 Verification Steps
- Guest creation/editing
  - Clear cookies, use guest check-in, ensure a `guest_email` cookie is set.
  - Create a set via UI; verify it appears in “Your Sets” and is editable.
  - Confirm `created_by` is populated in DB for the guest.
- Permissions parity
  - Visit a set you own as guest: edit/delete should be visible.
  - Visit another user’s set: controls should be hidden.
- RLS policies
  - Run the query in `VERIFY_RLS.md` in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm expected policies.
- Auth safety
  - Attempt guest password creation on an OAuth account; confirm it’s blocked.

## 🧭 Next Steps
- Guest codename UX
  - Build claim/release codename UI; display codename in header.
- Passcode entry UI
  - Complete the passcode form wiring to `src/lib/passcodeGrant.ts`; provide clear messages and error states.
- Z.ai model identifier
  - Update `src/lib/aiProviders.ts` and ContentEditor to use a valid Z.ai model code; test generation.
- Auth consistency audit
  - Ensure all set/card/question APIs check session OR `guest_email` consistently for ownership.
- Repo hygiene
  - Remove stray `nul` and `erssponheimgitfquiz` artifacts; confirm `.gitignore` coverage.

## 🌐 Environment & Deployment
- Local: `npm run dev` → `http://localhost:3000`.
- Supabase: verify policies via `VERIFY_RLS.md`.
- Vercel: ensure env vars match `DEPLOYMENT_HANDOFF.md` if deploying.

## ⚠️ Known Risks
- RLS is permissive for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE while server uses service role; tighten ownership checks as guest/session logic matures.
- Z.ai generation blocked until correct model identifier is configured.
