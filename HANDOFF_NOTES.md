### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Z.ai Issue Identified (Needs Fix)

**Problem Found:**
- Error: `{"error":{"code":"1211","message":"Unknown Model, please check the model code."}}`
- Root cause: Model identifier `zai-chat` is not recognized by Z.ai API
- Endpoint is CORRECT: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
- Model code is WRONG: Need to look up correct identifier in Z.ai docs

**Where to Fix:**
- `src/lib/aiProviders.ts` - Line 99 (questions), Line 211 (flashcards)
- `app/sets/[id]/ContentEditor.tsx` - Line 77

**Possible Solutions:**
Try model codes like: `paas-chat`, `zai-paas`, `gpt-4`, or check Z.ai documentation

## üö® Known Issues

### Z.ai AI Generation Fails
**Error**: `{"error":{"code":"1211","message":"Unknown Model, please check the model code."}}`

**Status**:
- ‚úÖ Endpoint is correct: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
- ‚ùå Model code `zai-chat` is wrong

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Z.ai API documentation for correct model identifier
2. Update in 3 files (see "Where to Fix" above)
3. Test again

**Workaround**:
User can manually type correct model code in "Model (optional)" field in ContentEditor

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### Session 3 Summary (This Session):
The flashcard study experience is now complete! Students can flip cards, track what they know/don't know, see progress, and toggle between study mode and grid overview. This was built from scratch in this session continuation (~387 lines in a single page component).

The implementation uses proper 3D CSS transforms for smooth card flipping, maintains state for all card statuses, and follows the spec with white/off-white card surfaces (not dark theme like the rest of the app).

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `transform: rotateY(180deg)` with `transformStyle: preserve-3d` for 3D flip
- `backfaceVisibility: hidden` to prevent showing reverse side during flip
- Map-based state tracking: `Map<string, CardStatus>` for each card's status
- Two view modes with seamless switching
- Progress bar and completion detection

### Session 2 Summary:
The quiz-taking experience is now fully functional! Students can actually take quizzes, see feedback, and get scored. This was built from scratch in Session 2 (~300 lines of new code + 3 API routes).

The AI generation infrastructure works, but Z.ai needs the correct model code. The endpoint URL was fixed in Session 2 (`/v1` ‚Üí `/api/paas/v4`), but the model identifier `zai-chat` doesn't exist in their API.

Error handling and loading states were significantly improved - users now see clear feedback when something goes wrong or when AI is processing.

### What to Pick Up Next:
1. **Test both interfaces in browser** (flashcard study + quiz taking) - should work perfectly
2. Fix Z.ai model code (quick win if you have docs)
3. Implement guest codenames (DB ready, just need UI)
4. Add deferred feedback mode to quizzes

**Server Status**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3002, database connected, no compilation errors

**Core Student Experience**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Both quiz-taking and flashcard study are fully built and ready to test!
